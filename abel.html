        <div id="p">
            <p><strong> Born and raised in Toronto, Tesfaye began his career in 2009 by anonymously releasing music on YouTube.
                Two years later, he co-founded the XO record label and released the mixtapes House of Balloons, 
                Thursday and Echoes of Silence, which gained recognition for his style of contemporary and 
                alternative R&B and the mystique surrounding his identity.In 2012, he signed with Republic Records and 
                rereleased the mixtapes in the compilation album Trilogy. He explored dark wave in his debut studio album Kiss Land
                (2013), which debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200.</strong></p>

            <p><strong> adopting the stage name the Weeknd, Tesfaye released music under two aliases; the Noise and Kin Kane.
            His current stage name was chosen in tribute to when he dropped out of school, took his mattress, 
            "left one weekend and never came home." However, Rose claims the name was his idea.
            The letter E was excluded to avoid trademark problems with pop rock band the Weekend.
            In the beginning of his career, Tesfaye worked at American Apparel. Due to his anonymity,
            his co-workers listened to his music without knowing it was him</strong></p>
